Hello, I'm Courtney. I'm a computer science and computational math student interested in essay and dramatic writing; I also moonlight as a grant writer.

My day job operates at the relative other end of the spectrum: I recently signed a full-time back-end software engineering offer with Microsoft, where I'll be working on cloud computing and data analytics platforms starting in the fall of 2019.

I interned at Microsoft in 2016, 2017, and 2018, and previously worked for SpaceX, Northrop Grumman, and Carnegie Mellon University. On campus, I manage and write grants for the Women's Engineering Institute; tutor students in math, the sciences, and career development; and engage in research. In March, I won the Goldwater Scholarship for research in the natural sciences, engineering, and mathematics. 

 I won a number of the nation's most competitive college scholarships in 2015; I now work to help students apply to—​and win—​scholarships for U.S. higher education. I believe those earning significantly above the national average have a moral responsibility to give generously to charity. Accordingly, I practice earning-to-give: deliberately pursuing a high-earning career, in part to donate a significant portion of earned income.
